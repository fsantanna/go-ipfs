# IPPS: Pub/Sub functionality for IPFS

The *Publish-Subscribe Pattern*, definition from Wikipedia:

> In software architecture, *publishâ€“subscribe* is a messaging pattern where 
> senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be 
> sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead 
> characterize published messages into classes without knowledge of which 
> subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in 
> one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without 
> knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.

Currently, there is no *pub/sub* mechanism available for IPFS users because 
there is no easy way to broadcast (or listen to) file submissions.
IPFS is *pull-driven* and not *push-driven*, i.e., you cannot say to the world 
"hey, look at this new cat picture".

We propose (and implement) two new commands to provide *pub/sub* for IPFS:

```
$ ipfs pub <topic-string> <ipfs-path>

$ ipfs sub <topic-string>
	<ipfs-path-1>
	...
	<ipfs-path-2>
	...
```

The command `ipfs pub` reads as

> Broadcast the file `<ipfs-path>` to all subscribers of `<topic-string>`.

The command `ipfs sub` reads as

> Whenever someone broadcasts a new file to `<topic-string>`, output its 
> `<ipfs-path>`.

We employ best-effort delivery, with no guarantees that publishers reach their 
subscribers.

This is an exercise.
Although we believe the proposed/desired API is powerful and generic for many 
[applications](#Examples)), the proposed [implementation](#Implementation) is 
naive and does not scale.
Therefore, the main question with this exercise is:

> Is it possible to support a scalable `ipfs sub` and `ipfs pub` API?

## Examples

### Hello World!

Alice at `HOST1` wants to publish the message `Hello World!` to all 
subscribers of the topic `cool-channel`.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/149632333" width="500" height="273" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/149632333">hello</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user28619189">Francisco Sant&#039;Anna</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

First, Alice adds the message with `ipfs add` and acquires the corresponding 
path:

```
alice@HOST1$ echo "Hello World!" | ipfs add -q
QmfM2r8seH2GiRaC4esTjeraXEachRt8ZsSeGaWTPLyMoG
```

Then, Alice publishes the path to `cool-channel`:

```
alice@HOST1$ ipfs pub cool-channel QmfM2r8seH2GiRaC4esTjeraXEachRt8ZsSeGaWTPLyMoG
```

Bob, at `HOST2`, wants to be notified about new files published to the topic 
`cool-channel`:

```
bob@HOST2$ ipfs sub cool-channel
QmfM2r8seH2GiRaC4esTjeraXEachRt8ZsSeGaWTPLyMoG
QmfM2r8seH2GiRaC4esTjeraXEachRt8ZsSeGaWTPLyMoG
...
```

Every time someone publishes a new file to `cool-channel`, Bob is notified with 
the hash of the new file.

Bob can avoid duplicate notifications as follows:

```
bob@HOST2$ ipfs sub cool-channel | awk '!a[$0]++'
QmfM2r8seH2GiRaC4esTjeraXEachRt8ZsSeGaWTPLyMoG
...
```

To read the contents of the new submission, Bob then uses `ipfs cat`:

```
bob@HOST2$ ipfs cat QmfM2r8seH2GiRaC4esTjeraXEachRt8ZsSeGaWTPLyMoG
Hello World!
```

### A Conversation

Alice and Bob want to exchange messages, similarly to how they already do 
through emails.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/149634615" width="500" height="273" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/149634615">conversation</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user28619189">Francisco Sant&#039;Anna</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

First, they both subscribe to topics representing their mailboxes:

```
alice@HOST1$ ipfs sub alice-mailbox | awk '!a[$0]++'
...

bob@HOST2$ ipfs sub bob-mailbox | awk '!a[$0]++'
...
```

A conversation is a directory defining a "protocol" with certain predefined 
files, e.g., `from`, `to`, and `message`:

```
alice@HOST1$ mkdir to-bob
alice@HOST1$ echo Alice > to-bob/from
alice@HOST1$ echo Bob > to-bob/to
alice@HOST1$ echo -e "Hello Bob,\nTalk to me.\nAlice" > to-bob/message
```

Alice publishes the conversation to `bob-mailbox`:

```
alice@HOST1$ ipfs add -r to-bob/
added QmXFyfUEXXNY13e7W15nEMDkZyuS2UqkiKQBxc6DHdqPbH to-bob/from
added QmYUTBNbN8wcEwGmoFQZhxKhnnRY6dZR32Fu5DvFGz3j2r to-bob/message

alice@HOST1$ ipfs pub bob-mailbox QmYJKvMFLyzbHYhxpLk2Xd6h8okoHNwmpLMBXu2gxqiRdp
```

Bob receives the notification:

```
bob@HOST2$ ipfs sub bob-mailbox | awk '!a[$0]++'
QmYJKvMFLyzbHYhxpLk2Xd6h8okoHNwmpLMBXu2gxqiRdp
```

Bob reads the message:

```

Bob
bob@HOST2$ cat QmYJKvMFLyzbHYhxpLk2Xd6h8okoHNwmpLMBXu2gxqiRdp/message
Hello Bob,
Talk to me.
Alice
```

Bob replies the message, keeping a *backlink* to the original message in the 
directory `previous`:

```
bob@HOST2$ mkdir to-alice
bob@HOST2$ mv QmYJKvMFLyzbHYhxpLk2Xd6h8okoHNwmpLMBXu2gxqiRdp/ to-alice/previous/
bob@HOST2$ echo Bob > to-alice/from
bob@HOST2$ echo Alice > to-alice/to
bob@HOST2$ echo -e "Hello Alice,\nThanks for your message.\nBob" > to-alice/message
```

Bob publishes the reply to `alice-mailbox`:

```
bob@HOST2$ ipfs add -r to-alice/
added QmYckDL4bLcDUBDG2XLhcTWTQbJGnigUZpzCRRC2rzJthE to-alice/from

bob@HOST2$ ipfs pub alice-mailbox QmQHioEDdCc6G4G4XsAUs2a2Uq6euuzAhf9Ym2bGHfFL2a
```

Alice receives the notification:

```
alice@HOST1$ ipfs sub alice-mailbox | awk '!a[$0]++'
QmQHioEDdCc6G4G4XsAUs2a2Uq6euuzAhf9Ym2bGHfFL2a
```

Alice reads the reply, also re-reading her original message:

```
alice@HOST1$ ipfs get QmQHioEDdCc6G4G4XsAUs2a2Uq6euuzAhf9Ym2bGHfFL2a
Saving file(s) to QmQHioEDdCc6G4G4XsAUs2a2Uq6euuzAhf9Ym2bGHfFL2a

```

Conversations can become private through public-key cryptography.

### A Simple Blockchain

TBD.

## Implementation

The current implementation is the
[*simplest thing that could possibly work*](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork).

<img src="pubsub.png" align="right" valign="top" width="200"/>

We assume that publishers and subscribers do not know each other and are not 
directly connected in the peer-to-peer network.
The figure in the right illustrates the general idea:

1. Node keeps its list of subscribed topics, `sublist`, from calls to `ipfs sub`.
2. Node keeps its list of published items, `publist`, from calls to `ipfs pub`.
3. Node periodically broadcasts its `publist` to connected peers.
4. Node appends received `publists` to its own `publist`.
5. Whenever `sublist` has an intersection with `publist`, Node redirects it to 
corresponding `ipfs sub`.

Eventually, all nodes receive all `publists` in the network.

Except for steps `1` and `5`, this behavior is similar to the one described for 
`wantlists` in the
[IPFS whitepaper](https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf)
, Section 3.4.4.

### Testing

### Source Walkthrough

To see all changes comparing to the latest commit of the official repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fsantanna/go-ipfs
$ git checkout no-sublist
$ git difftool fbb607dc661bfe6dcac4e875a22ff96cccfb395c
```

<!--
The real work IPFS nodes would need to do behind the scenes is to continuously 
broadcast information in the p2p network.
This new subsystem could use a different port that would remain closed in nodes 
not interested in participating in blockchains.

Also, the `<gen-block>` arguments of `ipfs pubsub` makes easy for nodes to 
ignore specific blockchains completely.
Each node could manually provide a white list of chains of interest in 
`~/.ipfs/config`.

These policies preserve the overall *pull* nature of IPFS, i.e., there is no 
way to force a node to subscribe for blockchain traffic or handle arbitrary 
`<gen-block>` hashes.

Looking at the IPFS Draft document (Section 3.4.4) seems like hacking with the 
`want_list` could provide a fast track to a working prototype.
A special bit flag could fix a `<gen-block>` so that any traffic matching
`ipfs publish <gen-block>` would be sent to the node.
For more scalability, peers sharing common `pubsub` interests should connect 
directly to one another.
-->

### Considerations

- Is the `wantlist` propagation described in the white paper scalable?
  Given the similarities, can we make the `publist` as scalable as the 
  `wantlist`?

- Reducing overhead:
  Also propagate the `sublist` of nodes

1. Overhead.
- only propagate PubList to P if matches P.SubList
- avoid resending the values peer already received from pub

- FLOODING
	- sublist ~ wantlist
	- publist propagates only if matches sublist of peer
- FAST
	- publisher discovering subscriber
		- SUB message could contain subscriber address
			- when P sees "K subs 'a' at S", then conect to S
	- subscriber discovering publisher
		- ipns with a growing list of peers that published to topic?
	- (only optimizations, not required)
- COOPERATION
	- ideia de contar ledger dos dois lados?
- ATTACKS
